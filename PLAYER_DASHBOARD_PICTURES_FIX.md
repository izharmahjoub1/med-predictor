# Player Dashboard Pictures Fix

## Issue

The player dashboard was not displaying profile pictures for players.

## Root Cause

1. The player dashboard view was using `Storage::url($player->player_picture)` directly instead of using the Player model's `player_picture_url` attribute
2. The PlayerDashboardController was creating a mock player object without including profile picture data
3. The Vue component didn't have profile picture display functionality

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Player Dashboard View

**File**: `resources/views/player-dashboard/index.blade.php`

-   Changed from `Storage::url($player->player_picture)` to `$player->player_picture_url`
-   Now properly uses the Player model's attribute accessor

### 2. Enhanced Player Model

**File**: `app/Models/Player.php`

-   Updated `getPlayerPictureUrlAttribute()` method to handle external URLs (like DiceBear API)
-   Added URL validation to distinguish between stored files and external URLs

### 3. Fixed PlayerDashboardController

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PlayerDashboardController.php`

-   Added `player_picture_url` to the mock player object
-   Now passes the user's profile picture to the player dashboard

### 4. Enhanced Vue Component

**File**: `resources/js/components/PlayerDashboard.vue`

-   Added profile picture section to the Profile tab
-   Displays player picture with fallback to initials
-   Shows player name, position, and club information

### 5. Added Profile Picture Upload

**File**: `resources/views/profile/partials/update-profile-information-form.blade.php`

-   Added file upload input for profile pictures
-   Shows current profile picture preview
-   Supports image uploads (JPEG, PNG, JPG, GIF up to 2MB)

### 6. Enhanced ProfileController

**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProfileController.php`

-   Added profile picture upload handling
-   Automatic storage management (deletes old pictures when updating)
-   Proper validation for image uploads

## How It Works Now

### Profile Picture Sources (in order of priority):

1. **Uploaded Profile Picture**: User-uploaded images stored in `storage/app/public/profile-pictures/`
2. **External URL**: DiceBear API URLs or other external image URLs
3. **FIFA Face URL**: FIFA Connect player face images
4. **Fallback**: Initials in a colored circle

### Display Locations:

1. **Player Dashboard Header**: Small profile picture in the top-right corner
2. **Player Dashboard Profile Tab**: Large profile picture with player details
3. **Stakeholder Gallery**: Profile pictures for all stakeholders
4. **Navigation**: User profile picture in the top navigation
5. **Profile Settings**: Profile picture preview and upload form

## Testing

### Test Player Setup:

-   **Email**: `john.doe@testfc.com`
-   **Password**: `password123`
-   **Profile Picture**: DiceBear API generated avatar

### Sample Data:

-   Created 15 sample stakeholders with profile pictures
-   Created 10 sample players with profile pictures
-   All using DiceBear API for placeholder avatars

## Access Points:

1. **Player Dashboard**: `/player-dashboard`
2. **Stakeholder Gallery**: `/stakeholder-gallery`
3. **Profile Settings**: `/profile`

## Technical Details
