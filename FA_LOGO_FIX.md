# FA Logo Fix

## Issue

The FA (The Football Association) logo was not displaying properly in the application. The original URL was returning 404 errors.

## Problem

The original FA logo URL in the database was:

```
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/47/FA_logo.svg
```

This URL was returning 404 errors, causing the FA logo to not display in the application.

## Solution

Updated the FA logo URL to the official FA logo from their CDN:

```
https://cdn.thefa.com/thefawebsite/assets/images/the-fa-logo.svg
```

This is the official, reliable source for The Football Association logo.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Update

-   Created and ran `UpdateFALogoSeeder` to update the existing FA record in the database
-   Updated the `association_logo_url` field for The Football Association

### 2. Seeder Update

-   Updated `AssociationSeeder.php` to use the new working URL for future database seeding
-   Ensures consistency across all database seeding operations

### 3. Cache Clearing

-   Cleared Laravel configuration, view, and application caches
-   Ensures immediate effect of the changes

## Final Result

The FA logo now uses the official URL from The FA's CDN:

-   **URL**: `https://cdn.thefa.com/thefawebsite/assets/images/the-fa-logo.svg`
-   **Status**: âœ… Working (HTTP 200)
-   **Format**: SVG (scalable vector graphics)
-   **Source**: Official FA CDN

## Testing

-   Verified URL accessibility with curl (HTTP 200 response)
-   Confirmed database update with Tinker
-   Cleared all Laravel caches for immediate effect

The FA logo should now display properly throughout the application.
